This repository hosts open biological dataset called Virus-MNIST. 
The dataset was created from superresolved Vaccinia Virus (VACV) particles micrographs obtained at Mercer Group of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (University College London, in 2018).
VACV particles were detected using in-house methodology (manuscript in preparation, stay tuned). Upon detection particles were embedded in a way to resemble the famous MNIST dataset.
